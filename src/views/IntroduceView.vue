      Every day of your life, it is important to take the time to “smell the
      roses” — to appreciate the experiences that lead to happiness. This is
      part of being truly happy. Happiness is a state of mind. It starts with
      accepting where you are, knowing where you are going and planning to enjoy
      every moment along the way. You know how to be happy, and feel that you
      have enough time or money or love or whatever you need to achieve your
      goals. And just feeling that you have enough of everything means that you
      do indeed have enough. You have to choose to be happy, and focus upon
      being happy, in order to be happy. If you instead focus upon knowing that
      you will be happy if you achieve something, you will never be happy, as
      you have not learned to “smell the roses”. The irony is that when you are
      happy, you are inevitably more productive, and far more likely to achieve
      what everything-seekers are seeking.
